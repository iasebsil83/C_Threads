This program is a simple utility library that will allow you to manipulate threads
a little bit easier than pthread.h does.

A demonstration program is made in src/prog.c.

More information about this library are available in lib/threads.c.

DISCLAIMER : This program is not a substitute of pthread.h but a complement.
             pthread.h gives a lot of options on thread management, threads.h is a way much simpler.
